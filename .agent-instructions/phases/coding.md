## 5 Mandatory Rules for Coding

### Rule 1: Code Quality First

**The Rule:**
- Quality matters more than speed
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Use consistent naming and structure
- Refactor as you go (don't leave technical debt)

**Code quality checklist:**
- [ ] Code is readable (clear variable names, short functions)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
- [ ] No code duplication (< 3% duplication)
- [ ] Functions are focused (do one thing well)
- [ ] Error handling is explicit
- [ ] Follows project style guide
- [ ] Uses consistent patterns
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"

**Example:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Complex, unclear intent
function process(a, b, c) {
  let x = a.map(v => v * 2).filter(v => v > c);
  return x.length > b ? x.slice(0, b) : x;
}

// ✅ Good: Clear intent, focused, well-named
function getTopPrioritiesUnderThreshold(items, maxCount, threshold) {
  const priorityItems = items
    .filter(item => item.priority <= threshold)
    .map(item => ({...item, priorityScore: item.priority * 2}))
    .sort((a, b) => b.priorityScore - a.priorityScore);
  
  return priorityItems.slice(0, maxCount);
}
```

### Rule 2: Test Coverage > 80%

**The Rule:**
- Write tests BEFORE or ALONGSIDE code (TDD)
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test happy path, edge cases, and errors
- Tests must pass before code is merged
- Keep tests fast and reliable

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Unit tests for all functions
- [ ] Integration tests for major flows
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error cases tested
- [ ] Coverage > 80%
- [ ] Tests run in < 30 seconds
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No flaky tests (tests that sometimes fail)

**Example test structure:**
```javascript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create user with valid email', () => {
      const result = createUser('test@example.com', 'password123');
      expect(result.id).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.email).toBe('test@example.com');
    });
    
    it('should reject user with invalid email', () => {
      expect(() => createUser('invalid', 'password'))
        .toThrow('Invalid email format');
    });
    
    it('should hash password', () => {
      const result = createUser('test@example.com', 'password');
      expect(result.password).not.toBe('password');
    });
  });
});
```

### Rule 3: Follow the Specification

**The Rule:**
- Understand requirements before coding
- Implement exactly what was specified
- No scope creep (additional features not in spec)
- Clarify ambiguities before coding
- Test against acceptance criteria

**Specification adherence checklist:**
- [ ] Understood all requirements before starting
- [ ] Clarified ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Implementation matches specification
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No additional features added (scope creep)
- [ ] Constraints (performance, security) met
- [ ] Edge cases from spec handled

**Example:**
```
Spec: "Users can search for posts by title"

✅ Implementation should:
- Accept search query (text)
- Return matching posts
- Case-insensitive matching
- Return empty array if no matches
- Support special characters in titles

❌ Don't implement:
- Filter by author (not in spec)
- Full-text search (not in spec)
- Save search history (not in spec)
```

### Rule 4: Performance & Security Matter

**The Rule:**
- Performance targets must be met
- Security vulnerabilities must be fixed
- Code must handle errors gracefully
- Sensitive data must be protected
- Assume malicious input

**Performance & security checklist:**
- [ ] API responses < 200ms (target)
- [ ] Page load time < 3s (target)
- [ ] Database queries < 100ms (target)
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Passwords hashed (bcrypt, scrypt)
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Logging for audit trails

**Security example:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: SQL injection, no password hashing
function loginUser(email, password) {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='${email}' AND password='${password}'`;
  return db.query(query);
}

// ✅ Good: Parameterized query, hashed password, error handling
async function loginUser(email, password) {
  const user = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1',
    [email]
  );
  
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');
  
  const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
  if (!isValid) throw new Error('Invalid password');
  
  return user;
}
```

### Rule 5: Document & Communicate

**The Rule:**
- Code must be self-documenting (clear names, structure)
- Complex logic must have comments explaining "why"
- Functions/classes must have documentation
- Git commits must explain changes
- Pull requests must be clear and reviewable

**Documentation checklist:**
- [ ] README updated (if applicable)
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Complex algorithms explained in comments
- [ ] Function/method documentation included
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Dependencies listed
- [ ] Setup instructions clear
- [ ] Git commit messages are descriptive
- [ ] PR description explains "why" and "what"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: No Tests (or Insufficient Tests)

**Problem:** Code without tests is broken code waiting to happen.

**Fix:** Write tests FIRST. Aim for >80% coverage. Test edge cases.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Ignoring Error Handling

**Problem:** Code that only handles the happy path fails in production.

**Fix:** Handle all error cases. Provide clear error messages. Log errors.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Skipping Security Review

**Problem:** Security vulnerabilities end up in production.

**Fix:** Always think security. Validate inputs. Use parameterized queries. Check OWASP top 10.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Unclear Commits and PRs

**Problem:** Team members don't understand what changed or why.

**Fix:** Write clear commit messages. Explain "why" in PRs. Reference requirements.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Following Specification

**Problem:** Implementing features that weren't requested or missing required features.

**Fix:** Clarify requirements. Stick to specification. Ask questions before coding.
