# Design Phase - Agent Rules & Procedures

This phase focuses on creating visual designs, user experiences, and interaction models that bridge system analysis and coding.

---

## 🎯 Phase Overview

**Goal:** Create beautiful, intuitive designs that users love and developers can implement.

**When to use this phase:**
- Creating UI mockups and wireframes
- Designing user flows and interactions
- Building design systems and components
- Creating interactive prototypes
- Designing responsive layouts
- Conducting design reviews and handoffs

**Typical workflow:** Understand → Sketch → Design → Prototype → Test → Handoff

**Deliverables:** Wireframes, mockups, prototypes, design systems, component libraries

## 4 Mandatory Rules for Design

### Rule 1: User-Centric Design

**The Rule:**
- Every design decision must serve the user
- Understand user goals, not just features
- Test designs with actual users when possible
- Accessibility is not optional, it's mandatory

**How to apply:**
```
For every design, ask:
1. Who is the user?
2. What is their goal?
3. What's the easiest way to achieve it?
4. Can users with disabilities use this?
5. Is this delightful, or just functional?
```

**Example:**
```
❌ Wrong: "Let's put all settings in a dropdown"
✅ Right: "Users need to change 5 settings frequently.
          Let's make those 5 visible, with advanced settings
          in a dropdown. Test with actual users."
```

### Rule 2: Design Consistency

**The Rule:**
- Consistent visual language across the product
- Consistent patterns for common interactions
- Consistent component usage
- Documented design system

**Consistency checklist:**
- [ ] Color palette defined and applied
- [ ] Typography system (font sizes, weights, line heights)
- [ ] Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
- [ ] Component library (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- [ ] Interaction patterns (hover, active, disabled states)
- [ ] Icon system (consistent style and sizing)
- [ ] Error/success/warning/info states defined

**Example:**
```
A button should:
- Always look like a button
- React the same way to user interaction
- Use the same spacing and typography
- Work the same across different screens
```

### Rule 3: Accessibility is Mandatory

**The Rule:**
- All designs must be usable by people with disabilities
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards
- Text must be readable (not too small)
- Interactive elements must be keyboard-accessible
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

**Accessibility checklist:**
- [ ] Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text
- [ ] Minimum font size 12-14px for body text
- [ ] Focus states visible on interactive elements
- [ ] Icons have text labels or aria-labels
- [ ] Forms have proper labels
- [ ] Modals can be closed with Escape key
- [ ] No content locked behind hover-only
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works

**Example:**
```
❌ Wrong: "Success! (in green text only)"
✅ Right: "✓ Success! (green text + checkmark + clear message)"
```

### Rule 4: Document All Design Decisions

**The Rule:**
- Why did you make this choice?
- What alternatives were considered?
- What constraints influenced this?
- What assumptions are you making?

**Documentation checklist:**
- [ ] Design rationale documented
- [ ] Alternatives considered and compared
- [ ] Constraints acknowledged
- [ ] Assumptions listed
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Interactions explained
- [ ] Responsive behavior defined
- [ ] Accessibility approach documented

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Designing Without Understanding Users

**Problem:** Creating beautiful designs that users don't understand or find hard to use.

**Fix:** Always research users first. Test early and often.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping Accessibility

**Problem:** Designing beautiful interfaces that don't work for people with disabilities.

**Fix:** Accessibility is mandatory. Test with real accessibility tools and users.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Inconsistent Design System Usage

**Problem:** Using different styles, spacings, and components in different parts of the interface.

**Fix:** Build and stick to a design system. Make components reusable.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Poor Responsive Design

**Problem:** Designs that look great on desktop but are unusable on mobile.

**Fix:** Start with mobile, test on actual devices, use proper breakpoints.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Insufficient Documentation

**Problem:** Designs that developers can't implement because they don't understand the intent.

**Fix:** Over-document. Annotate everything. Include reasoning.
