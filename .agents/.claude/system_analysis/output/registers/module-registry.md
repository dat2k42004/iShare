## MoSCoW Summary
| Priority | Count | Modules |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Must | 10 | M01–M10, M13 |
| Should | 3 | M11, M12, M16 |
| Could | 2 | M14, M15 |

## AI Module Fallback (DEC-008)
| Module | Fallback khi AI off |
|--------|-------------------|
| M06 Search | Full-text keyword search |
| M08 Moderation | Manual moderation queue only |
| M05 Topic | User tự chọn topic, không có gợi ý AI |

## Issues Resolved This Phase
| Issue | Summary | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| ISS-040 | Search scope & type | Semantic (post); exact match (user, tag); no comment search → QA-022 |
| ISS-041 | Chat scope | DM + Group Chat in scope → M16 → QA-023 (amended Phase 5, Group Chat is independent of Group/M11 — see ISS-163) |
| ISS-042 | AI Layer MoSCoW | Elevated to Must (M06/M08/M05 depend on it) → QA-024 |

## Decisions
- **DEC-008**: AI Layer Feature Flag — global toggle via Admin config or env var; defined fallback per module when AI is off.

## Phase 4 Feature Details

## Amendment — Phase 5, M16 Chat & Messaging Deep Dive (2026-09-30)

M16 (Chat & Messaging) deep dive completed. Key correction: the original Phase 3/4 scoping described Group Chat as a feature *within* Group (M11) — this was wrong. Group Chat is a fully independent multi-party (3+) conversation feature, unrelated to Group/community membership. M16's dependency on M11 has been removed (M16 now depends only on M01). See `issue-queue.md` ISS-155–ISS-165 and `qa-log.md` QA-208–QA-224 for the full deep dive (message status/read-receipts, edit/delete policy, content scope, rate limiting, DM open-messaging policy, Group Chat governance, pagination/notification). One item remains open: **OPEN-003** — no Block or Report mechanism for chat messages in MS1 (deferred to a later phase).

M16 status: deep-dive substantially complete.

---

## Amendment — Phase 5, M14 Feed & Discovery Deep Dive (2026-10-01)

M14 (Feed & Discovery) deep dive completed. Feature list expanded from the original Phase 3 one-liner ("Personalized feed, trending posts") into 4 concrete tabs: **Trending** (3 sub-views — Post/Topic/Tag; Topic/Tag reuse DEC-052 unchanged, Post uses a new decay formula DEC-124), **Following** (chronological, reuses Follow targets from M07), **Group** (new — chronological feed aggregated from all groups the user has joined, Public+Private), **Newest** (chronological, site-wide, excludes Group-sourced posts). No algorithmic/AI-personalized "For You" tab was added — this removed M14's dependency on M13 (AI Layer); M14 now depends only on M03 (Post) and M05 (Topic & Tag), see DEC-125. Guest access, pagination (infinite scroll, 20/load, cursor-based), new-content notification (polling-based banner, not real-time), and BANNED/HEAVY-warn content visibility (not excluded, relies on existing label/privacy mechanisms) were also settled — see `issue-queue.md` ISS-166–ISS-188 and `qa-log.md` QA-225–QA-240 for the full deep dive.

M14 status: deep-dive complete, no open issues.

---

## Amendment — Phase 5, M15 Analytics & Stats Deep Dive (2026-10-01)

M15 (Analytics & Stats) deep dive completed. Feature list expanded from the original Phase 3 one-liner into 3 concrete ADMIN-only dashboards: **User Stats** (account status breakdown, registration trend, role breakdown, grade/Khối breakdown, warn-level breakdown), **Content Stats** (Post by publish_state/mod_state, post creation trend, Topic distribution, Comment trend), **Moderation Stats** (Report by status/category, Warn issued over time, Ban/Unban over time, Appeal by type/outcome). All metrics are derived from existing data — no new tracking infrastructure (DAU/WAU/MAU-style metrics were explicitly considered and dropped). Access is ADMIN-only (MOD access and a per-MOD "top report handler" leaderboard idea were both considered and dropped for complexity vs. Could-priority value). Time filter uses fixed presets (Today/7d/30d/All-time), no custom range. Computation is real-time (query-on-load), not batched — unlike Leaderboard (M12), admin traffic is low enough that this is not a performance concern. CSV export was explicitly deferred — see **OPEN-004**. See `issue-queue.md` ISS-178–ISS-184 and `qa-log.md` QA-241–QA-247 for the full deep dive.

M15 status: deep-dive complete. Open item: OPEN-004 (CSV export, deferred).

---

**Phase 5 status: all 16 modules' deep-dive interviews are now complete** (M01–M13 completed in earlier sessions; M11 amendment, M09 amendment, M12, M14, M15, M16 completed in this and the prior session). Remaining open items carried forward: OPEN-001 (AI budget), OPEN-002 (tech stack), OPEN-003 (M16 Block/Report), OPEN-004 (M15 CSV export) — none block spec writing for their respective modules; all are deliberate defers, not unresolved unknowns.

---

## Amendment — Phase 6: Cross-cutting Concerns (2026-10-01)

Phase 6 (Cross-cutting concerns) completed. Scope checked against the full BA-INTERVIEW-RULES.md Phase 6 checklist (auth/session, authorization, account lifecycle, audit logging, notification framework, search, file/media upload, moderation & reporting, i18n, timezone, config/feature flags, analytics events, data retention, plus the AI/LLM sub-checklist) — most items were found to already be resolved by individual module deep dives (M01 session/auth, M06 Search, M07 Notification, M08 Moderation, M10 Admin config, M13 AI Layer all cover their respective cross-cutting topic in depth already). Only genuinely open cross-cutting items were raised as new issues: **timezone & date handling** (DEC-127 — UTC storage, Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh business timezone, applies retroactively to every existing "N days/weeks" computation across M03/M08/M09/M12/M15), **i18n readiness** (DEC-128 — Vietnamese-only but i18n-key-ready architecture), **general data-retention principle** (DEC-129 — audit log & chat kept indefinitely; "only hard-delete when genuinely safe" principle formalized for the whole project), **file upload virus scanning** (DEC-130 — not needed, image-only + CDN transcode), and 4 AI/LLM-specific gaps not covered by M13's deep dive: **third-party data privacy disclosure** (DEC-131 — ToS/Privacy Policy page), **Topic Suggestion hallucination handling** (DEC-132), **AI decision output logging** (DEC-133 — new `ai_decision_log` table), and **analytics event-tracking infrastructure** (formalized as **OPEN-005**, deferred — no event-tracking beyond existing business-data-derived dashboards for MS1). See `issue-queue.md` ISS-189–ISS-196, `qa-log.md` QA-248–QA-255, and `decisions.md` DEC-127–DEC-133 for the full deep dive.

Phase 6 status: complete. Open item: OPEN-005 (event-tracking infra, deferred).

---

**Phase 6 complete. Per the BA-AGENT.md 9-phase protocol, next is Phase 7 — Non-functional requirements** (performance, scalability, availability, security, privacy, reliability/backup, maintainability, portability, browser/device/OS support matrix, accessibility, observability — each with a measurable target).

## Amendment — Phase 7 prep: Tech Stack confirmed (2026-10-04)

Tech stack confirmed (DEC-134–137, closes OPEN-002): Java + Spring Boot; React + Vite SPA (no SSR at MS1, OPEN-006) with shared UI Kit (base library OPEN-007); PostgreSQL + pgvector; Cloudinary; OpenAI; Tiptap JSON; JWT; Spring Mail + SMTP; SSE for all realtime (supersedes the WebSocket notes in M07); AI toggle in Admin Panel (DEC-092/093); no deployment at MS1. Next: Phase 7 (NFR) and Phase 8 (data model, per-module noun extraction → entities → system ERD, QA-262) — order to be confirmed.
